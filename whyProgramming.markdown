	<p><i>Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out. -Chris Pine</i></p>

<p>Programming to me is valuable for two reasons. The first is that, as humanity has been figuring out, computers are able to solve problems easily that were prohibatively complex for humans without them. The power of computers have improved the quality of life of almost everyone on the planet. To be a programmer is to be the one who commands these machines. And so, the ability for a programmer to do something useful in the word is limited only by his/her intellect, creativity and determination. The second reason programming is valuable to me is more intimate. Good code for good codes sake is inherently satisfiying much in the same way good art or math is. As analogy, not all proofs in math are created equal (even if correct). A "good" proof is one that is elagant and concise. Paul Erdos believed that God, as he saw him/her, had a list of the most elegant proofs of every mathematical fact. I.e. the best proofs have already been written, it is the job of the mathematician to uncover them. "Good" code I believe is the same way; elegance and aesthetic are truly its esoteric values. The best code for a problem has already been written, it is the job of a programmer to uncover it. The act of creating an elagant solution using only ones creativity and inginuety, is deeply rewarding.
