    <p>Hi! I'm Luke. I recently completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics <i>cum laude</i> with a minor in Business Administration from Northeastern University. My professional interests are quite broad and span Software Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Statistics and the intersection thereof. One of my most rewarding software experiences was in backend web development, working on a high traffic e-commerce corporation's search engine as a co-op. Currently, I am electrified by the prospect of marrying my mathematical and scientific aptitudes with my software focused skill set, and am in search for an oppurtunity to do so. </p>
    <p>I also enjoy the delve into pure math, computer science and more theoretical topics. 
    I have co-published my own math research in discrete geometry. Additionally, some of my favorite course work has regarded advanced algorithm theory and a large span number theoretic topics. I am a top down thinker by default. Thus, even when having my hands deep in a large codebase or working in a more applied manner, I always come with the theory first.</p>
    <p> 
    I have been perenially interested in financial markets as well. A dream of mine is to leverage my creativity and aformentioned skills to rigoursly understand, or act as an agent in, the market for public equities.
        </p>
    <p>
    Outside of profession I am an avid yogi, guitarist, reader, meditator, skateboarder, hiker, poker player and investor. In this website you will find more information about my course work, research experience, projects, my interest in the field, an abridged list of my must read books. Feel free to reach me at boyer.l@northeastern.edu.
